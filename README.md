# command-line-parser
A (hopefully) flexibly starting point for a library capable of parsing and validating command line commands with custom arguments, prefixes, commands, etc. each with their own custom validation rules.

Solution.java contains the original problem statement along with the configuration of the code base to solve tests passed in via the original rule set.

Note that the code base is designed to potentially accomodate custom rules flexibly.
